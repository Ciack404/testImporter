- Installation steps

Clone the repo: the executable is already built (due to the necessity of having a machine with golang environment installed)

- How to run your code / tests

./testImporter -f softwareadvice.json

or

./testImporter -f capterra.yaml

- Was it your first time writing a unit test, using a particular framework, etc?

No, I use Golang and MongoDB

- What would you have done differently if you had had more time

Added more tests
